Abstract classes>> cannot be instantiated directly, if something fromt that class needs 
to be used, then it needs to instantiated by another, class, no directly. If its methods and
properties are abstract, then the class also needs to be abstract.

The old property call Var is the same as a public for the php 5 and on

The constructor method can also receive parameters 

Private and protected are not to be instantiated outside the class. Private can only be accesd
inside the class, and protected can be accessed in a child class 

All the magic methods start with the __methodName >> Double underscore

Set and get methods are used not as a common method but as a class property.
The way you call then is the same as calling an object property and not a common method,
because they are built in function of object oriented languages
Eg: $post - new Post;
$post->name = Testing; //setting name to posting inside the __set method
echo $post->name; //printing out the name from __get method

__isset() method return a value if the property is already set or not
it returns a boolean value of true or false

Static properties >> Static things cannot have its value changed. Thats refers to values that
wont be changed along the way
Use the word self:: to access static properties from its own class and use the ClassName:: to access static methods from static outer classes


Autoloading classes>> SPL autoload classes files will autoload all the classes for you


PDO >> php data object. Gives us nice and secure interface to interact with the database.

Binding method >> allows us to fetch and insert data into the database

Building a custom MVC application - The structure


In order to access the Class and method by the url, we have to create the doc.htaccess file. So it comes in as a root request and through a get we can create that. This takes some parameters that will then be executed.


After creating the bootstrap method, create the controller class

For convention, when creating the class files, the controllers files are plural and the model files are singular

inside a class you should use 
if (){

} 

wheres inside a page with html files you should use <?php  if(): ?> and <?php endif ?>
the same for foreach, while, do and for loops
